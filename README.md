# IDecide Votiing App
Idecide voting is an idea where power entirely belongs to the people. Wit Idecide, we are seeking to make the process of voting/electoral process as decentralised as possible by leveraging the power of blockchain. 

I built this project as my University final year project. If you love it please give it a star
